Hello! This is my main and crowing jewel so far that I have created using HTML CSS and JS. I got into photography a few years ago from now (2025) and I wanted to showcase some of my work. This was also not made now (2025) i'm just now getting around to putting a readme.txt on here. (Last updated July 8, 2024)

I originally made a photography portfolio 2 years ago from now (2025) and I was unhappy with how it turned out as it was my first real project in HTML CSS and JS. However I had created it mostly through using tutorials and following them to the letter. So this website was made to be the culmination of the skills I learned from that previous website as well as some alterations in design I wanted to make from the original.

So this is the final product. I hope you all enjoy, as this is one of the works I am very proud of currently and it helps me constantly to showcase my photography to people.

***----------- IMPORTANT INFO -----------***

**This project utilizes a Lightbox jquery script created by Lokesh Dhakar for the image grid and functionality.** All other JS functionality (page loading screen, dropdown menu) was created by me.

Thank you for reading, Zayden.
